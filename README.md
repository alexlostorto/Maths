This program contains many maths functions which you will probably find useful!

```python

def linearSolve(start, end, between):
def geometricSolve(start, end, between):
def ratioSimplify(ratiostr):
def addFractions(n1, d1, n2, d2):
def root(exponent, number):
def geometricCreate(start, multiplier, length):
def linearCreate(start, interval, length):
def timeElapsed(function, *args):
def quadraticSequenceCreate(a, b, c, length):
def quadraticSequenceSolve(quadraticList):
def lcm(x, y):

def simulatenousSolve(set1, sum1, set2, sum2):
def linearSequenceSolve(linearList):
def linearSequenceCreate(a, b, length):
def printReturn(args):
def quadraticCreate(a, b, c, length, *args):
def quadraticSolve(a, length, *args):
def checkPrime(number, *args):
def listPrimes(start, length, *args):
def stampToDate(timeStamp, *args):
def quadraticSolver(a, b, c):
def interiorAngle(sides):
def exteriorAngle(sides):
```

## How it Works

#### Interior Angle

1. Find the exterior angle by doing 360 divided by the number of sides. Then use angles on a straight line to work out the interior angle.

```python
return 180-(360/int(sides))
```
